README for OWID COVID-19 Data

Overview
The OWID COVID-19 Data is a comprehensive dataset containing global COVID-19 statistics, including cases, deaths, hospitalizations, testing, and vaccinations. 
This dataset has been processed to improve data quality by handling missing values, converting data types, and ensuring consistency.

Data Source & Acknowledgment
The OWID COVID-19 Data is provided by Our World in Data (OWID), an independent research organization that compiles and maintains high-quality global data on COVID-19. 
The original dataset is available on their GitHub repository under the Creative Commons BY 4.0 license.
This project acknowledges the efforts of OWID researchers, analysts, and contributors for making this dataset available to the public.

Database Schema
The dataset is stored in a database schema named db_covid, with the main table:
owid-covid-data

Views
Several views have been created for easier data access and analysis:
total_cases_per_location_per_year –   Aggregates total COVID-19 cases per location, grouped by year.
total_cases_per_continent_per_year –   Aggregates total COVID-19 cases per continent, grouped by year.
top10_total_cases_per_year –     Retrieves the top 10 locations with the highest total cases for each year.
top5_total_cases_per_continent –   Retrieves the top 5 locations in total cases per continent.
survival_and_mortality_by_year_per_continent –   Computes survival and mortality rates for each year per continent.
locations –   Provides a list of unique locations included in the dataset.
continents –   Lists all continents present in the dataset.


Stored Procedures
The following stored procedures automate common data processing tasks:
survival_and_mortality_per_yr_by_continent –   Computes the survival and mortality rates per continent for each year.
get_top10_in_total_cases_per_yr –   Retrieves the top 10 locations with the highest total cases for a given year.
total_cases_by_location_per_yr –   Aggregates total cases for each location per year.
totalcase_summary_by_continent –   Generates a summary of total cases per continent.
totalcase_summary_by_location –   Generates a summary of total cases per location.


Data Cleaning Steps
Identified and replaced non-numeric values in numeric columns.
Standardized date formats.
Converted appropriate columns to BIGINT or DOUBLE based on data type requirements.
Removed duplicate or redundant records to improve query performance.


Notes
The dataset is updated regularly. Ensure that stored procedures are executed after data updates.
Use the views for efficient querying rather than querying the main table directly.
