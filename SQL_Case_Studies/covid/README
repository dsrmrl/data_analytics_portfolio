README for OWID COVID-19 Data

Overview
The OWID COVID-19 Data is a comprehensive dataset containing global COVID-19 statistics, including cases, deaths, hospitalizations, testing, and vaccinations. 
This dataset has been processed to improve data quality by handling missing values, converting data types, and ensuring consistency.

Data Source & Acknowledgment
The OWID COVID-19 Data is provided by Our World in Data (OWID), an independent research organization that compiles and maintains high-quality global data on COVID-19. 
The original dataset is available on their GitHub repository under the Creative Commons BY 4.0 license.
This project acknowledges the efforts of OWID researchers, analysts, and contributors for making this dataset available to the public.

Database Schema
The dataset is stored in a database schema named db_covid, with the main table:
owid-covid-data

Views
Several views have been created for easier data access and analysis:

total_cases_per_location_per_year
total_cases_per_continent_per_year
top10_total_cases_per_year
top5_total_cases_per_continent
survival_and_mortality_by_year_per_continent
locations
continents

Stored Procedures
The following stored procedures automate common data processing tasks:

survival_and_mortality_per_yr_by_continent
get_top10_in_total_cases_per_yr
total_cases_by_location_per_yr
totalcase_summary_by_continent
totalcase_summary_by_location


Data Cleaning Steps
Identified and replaced non-numeric values in numeric columns.
Standardized date formats.
Converted appropriate columns to BIGINT or DOUBLE based on data type requirements.


Notes
The dataset is updated regularly. Ensure that stored procedures are executed after data updates.
Use the views for efficient querying rather than querying the main table directly.
