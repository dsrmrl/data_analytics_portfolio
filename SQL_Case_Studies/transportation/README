Public Transport Utilisation - Average Trip Distance

Dataset Overview

This project analyzes the "Public Transport Utilisation - Average Trip Distance" dataset from data.gov.sg. The dataset provides insights into the average trip distances across different transportation modes over the years (2004~2014).

**Data Processing Techniques

To analyze and process the dataset, the following SQL techniques were applied:
Aggregations: Used to compute summary statistics such as avg, min,max and stddev of distance per trip
Window Functions: Applied calculate year-over-year changes.
Views: Created to simplify data retrieval by structuring frequently used queries into reusable views.
Stored Procedures: Developed to allow dynamic data retrieval based on input parameters such as year or transport mode.

Acknowledgment
